- Fortnightly FTE: 240 ÷ 24 = 10
- Total with 5 categories: 5 × 10 = 50 FTE/fortnight
```

##### Demand Calculation
```
Example:
- Cohort: 12 trainees in LT-FO phase
- Demand: 12 × 1 (1:1 ratio) = 12 FTE
- Multiple cohorts add up
```

##### Utilization
```
Example:
- Supply: 50 FTE
- Demand: 45 FTE
- Utilization: 45 ÷ 50 × 100 = 90%
```

##### Cross-Location
```
Example:
- NZ cohort using AU trainers
- Adds to AU demand
- Reduces NZ local demand
```

> - Can train Captains and First Officers
> - Cannot train Cadets
> - Primary resource for Captain training (P2 priority)
> 
> **LHS** (Left-Hand Seat Trainers)
> - Can only train First Officers
> - Most specialized category
> - Dedicated to FO training (P3 priority)

#### Tips & Best Practices
1. **Capacity Planning**
   - Keep utilization between 80-90%
   - Plan 3-6 months ahead
   - Consider seasonal variations

2. **Cross-Location Training**
   - Use sparingly for peak demands
   - Consider travel/accommodation costs
   - Plan 2-3 months in advance

3. **Scenario Management**
   - Create baseline scenario first
   - Test "what-if" scenarios
   - Document assumptions

### 9. Future Enhancements
- Video tutorials
- Interactive quizzes
- User feedback system
- FAQ section based on common queries
- Multi-language support
- Offline help documentation
- PDF export of help content

### 10. Q&A System (Tiered Approach)

#### Phase 1: Smart FAQ System (No LLM Required)
- **Pre-built Q&A Database**
  - Common questions with structured answers
  - Multiple phrasings for same question
  - Keyword tagging for better matching
  - Links to relevant help sections

- **Intelligent Matching**
  ```javascript
  // Example Q&A structure
  {
    questions: [
      "How do I handle trainer shortage?",
      "What to do when demand exceeds supply?",
      "Not enough trainers available"
    ],
    keywords: ["shortage", "deficit", "exceed", "insufficient"],
    answer: {
      summary: "When demand exceeds supply, you can...",
      full: "Detailed explanation with examples...",
      solutions: ["Use cross-location", "Adjust timing", "Optimize allocation"],
      relatedTopics: ["cross-location", "priorities", "optimization"]
    }
  }
  ```

- **Fuzzy Matching Algorithm**
  - Handles typos and variations
  - Synonym recognition
  - Relevance scoring
  - Returns multiple matches ranked by confidence

#### Phase 2: Guided Decision Trees
- **Problem-specific workflows**
  - "I have a shortage" → When? → Which trainers? → Solutions
  - "I need to add cohorts" → How many? → Which pathway? → When?
  - Visual decision paths with clear outcomes

- **Context-aware suggestions**
  - Based on current page/view
  - Considers user's data (if shortage exists)
  - Provides actionable next steps
