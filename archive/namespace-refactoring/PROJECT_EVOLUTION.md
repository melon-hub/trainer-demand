   - Real-time dashboards
   - Toast notifications

### Code Growth
- **Initial**: ~3,000 lines
- **Current**: ~11,000+ lines
- **Features**: 50+ major features
- **Bug Fixes**: 100+ issues resolved

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Iterative Development** - Regular releases with focused improvements
2. **User Feedback Integration** - Quick response to user needs
3. **Performance First** - Always considering speed and efficiency
4. **Visual Feedback** - Clear indicators for all actions

### Challenges Overcome

2. **State Management** - Without frameworks, careful state tracking
3. **Browser Compatibility** - Ensuring consistent behavior
4. **Performance at Scale** - Handling 100+ cohorts smoothly

## Future Vision

### Immediate Priorities
- Fix dashboard timeline synchronization
- Resolve white dot visibility in NZ view
- Add snapshot functionality for charts

### Long-term Goals
- Multi-fleet support
- Advanced optimization algorithms
- Predictive analytics
- Mobile responsive design
- API integration capabilities

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Pure JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Libraries**: Chart.js for visualizations
- **Architecture**: Single-page application, no build tools
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Deployment**: Static file hosting

## Impact
This application has evolved from a simple planning tool to a comprehensive training management system capable of handling complex multi-location airline operations with sophisticated demand forecasting and resource optimization.
